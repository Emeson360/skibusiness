										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong class="color-secondary" style="font-size: 17px;">It shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to hear that everyone here at Candide is obsessed with gardening. Which means our spare time is split pretty evenly between playing around in our own gardens and reading about other people&#8217;s.</strong></p>
<p>With this in mind, we thought we would share with you our top ten gardening blogs for 2019 so you can enjoy them as well! Do you think your garden&#8217;s too small every time you want to add something new, but it always feels too big whenever you&#8217;ve got some weeding to do? Then you may have a middle-sized garden, and Alexandra Campbell is the gardener for you! Whether you&#8217;re struggling for time or need help with your cannas, struggling with mobility or need help with your courgettes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then fill in a second layer of a different type of greenery around the outer edge, cascading over the first layer a bit. Fill in the inside with a spiky branch that stands up, like Fraser fir.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Middle-Sized Garden is packed full of expert advice. It&#8217;s the place to go if you want to feel like you&#8217;re talking to a gardener who seems to know <a class="color-secondary" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="#">everything about everything</a>. Dan Cooper takes a &#8220;more is more&#8221; approach to his jungle garden on the Kentish coast. With its warm, sheltered microclimate, the Frustrated Gardener has created an exotic haven brimming full of spectacular subtropical flowers.</p>

<p>Mark Ridsdill Smith is the container gardening genius behind Vertical Veg.

And he is showing us all how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Vertical Veg is essential reading for anyone feeling limited by their lack of space or uninspired by their surroundings. Mark always finds a way to make gardening accessible and fun, no matter how unpromising the area might look to begin with.</p>
